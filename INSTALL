In order to run the tests you need a working mysql server running with
permissions to create and delete tables.

The connection information is taken from the following environment
variables which you can set to control this behaviour:

dbname:   ENV{DBD_MYSQL_DBNAME}, or default to 'test'
user:     ENV{DBD_MYSQL_USER},   or default to ''
password: ENV{DBD_MYSQL_PASSWD}, or default to ''
table:    ENV{DBD_MYSQL_TABLE},  or default to 'tbcdbitest'
