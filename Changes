Revision history for Class::DBI::mysql.

0.16  2003-06-30
        - removed search_match() and initials() which should be
          implemented in any class that needs them.
        - deprecated count() in favour of Class::DBI->count_all

0.15  2003-05-30
        - added DBD::mysql as a pre-req (thanks to Nicholas Clark)

0.14  2003-03-28
        - brought in line with Class::DBI 0.91
        - no longer support CURDATE() etc. Much easier to implement
          things like this in Class::DBI itself now.

0.13  2002-03-09
        - untaint the column names in set_up_table

0.12  2001-11-09
        - added column_type()

0.11  2001-11-01
        - added enum_vals()

0.10  2001-10-07
        - brought commit() into line with Class::DBI (needs 0.35)

0.09  2001-10-05
        - tweaks to commit() to cope with overloaded values
          (temporary measure until this gets rolled into Ima::DBI)
        [commit() still doesn't work with the latest Class::DBI features]

0.08  2001-07-18
        - 'initials' method had problem with DISTINCT and ORDER BY in
           older MySQLs. Changed how it was implemented.

0.07  2001-07-18
        - added 'initials' method
        - Moved to Test::More

0.06  2001-07-08
        - reversed order of set-up in set_up_table to specify PRIMARY
          before ALL, to avoid bug in inheritance where it would add
          PRIMARY to ALL, even if you were just about to change PRIMARY.
        - fixed bug with those tighter restrictions!

0.05  2001-07-07
        - introduced tighter restrictions on tests for ORDER BY RAND
          and FULLTEXT searching, which weren't implemented until 3.23.02
        - added attributes() and search_range() [Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa]

0.04  2001-06-23
        - first CPAN release
        - renamed to Class::DBI::mysql at the request of Michael Schwern

0.03  2001-06-23
        - fixed bug in test where, if the last table in the database
          contained an underscore in its name, magically autoincrementing
          the name would fail to give a valid table name.

0.02  2001-06-14
	- added support for CURDATE(), NOW()

0.01  2001-05
	- original version (Class::DBI::MySQL)
